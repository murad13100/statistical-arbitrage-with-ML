# statistical-arbitrage-with-ML

This project was heavily inspired by the book "Quantitative Trading Strategies Using Python: Technical Analysis, Statistical Testing, and Machine Learning" by Liu Peng. I adapted and extended many of the machine learning concepts and code examples from the book to suit my own dataset and trading framework.
